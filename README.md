Asteroids
=====================
 
**Genre** 
- The space arcade.

**The target audience**
- The game is designed for people of all ages.

**Gameplay**

- The objective of Asteroids is to destroy asteroids.The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. 
Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction.
The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen. Objects wrap around screen edges for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid. Play continues to the last ship lost, which ends the game.
